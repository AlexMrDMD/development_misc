# Delaunay Triangulation

The <b>folder oracle</b> contains a <i>non-optimized</i> implementation for a <i>delaunay 
triangulation</i>. The following two links were very helpful:

* https://github.com/sokeroner/Delaunay-Triangulation/ 
* http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/algorithms/general/article.php/c8901

The goal was to <i>understand</i> the algorithm rather than to make it fast.
