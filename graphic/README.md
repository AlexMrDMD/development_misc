[Silk](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) is a smooth, free icon set, also with [mini](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/mini/).

[Inkscape.pm](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/tree/master/graphic/svg/inkscape/perl/Inkscape.pm#readme) is a perl wrapper to produce svg/inkscape files.
As everything here, it is very beta!

Take a look at (2geom](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lib2geom). Apparently, this is the 2D library that inkscape uses.
