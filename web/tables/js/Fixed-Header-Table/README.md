## Fixed-Header-Table

Created in order to test the capabilities of [Fixed-Header-Table](https://github.com/golovko/Fixed-Header-Table) 
and to have a simple testcase.

It turned out that a table's header is drawn too wide (or the body too narrow) 
if the table has no scrollbar.  compare `SimpleExampleSmall.html` and 
`SimpleExampleMedium.html`. (If somebody knows how to prevent that, please 
let me know).
