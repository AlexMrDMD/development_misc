# A simple example for ANTLR

This *simple example* for ANTLR was found in an [excellent answer on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1932664/180275)

I have compiled it on windows, hence the [do.bat](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/parser/antlr/do.bat)-batch file for `cmd.exe`.

The folders **step_1** and **step_2** are almost the same, but in **step_2**, an expression is really evaluated while **step_1** just checks for validity of
the expression.
