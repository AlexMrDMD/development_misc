These perl files are supposed to create svg files that also could have been produced by *inkscape*.

The idea is to first create an inkscape-svg file with these perl files, then to open the created files
in inkscape and do some finetuning to the graphic and then save it to a different file. Finally, the
perl-created and fine-tuned files can be diff'ed.

Very beta, currently!
