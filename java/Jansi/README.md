## SimpleTest.java

A simple test that outputs some text in different colors.


## WindowsTerminalWidthHeight.java

Determines the Width and Height (and other figures) of Terminal. 

I was able to compile and run it on Windows (`cmd.exe`). I have no idea if it
works on Unix and Mac too.

The [WindowsAnsiOutputStream](https://raw.github.com/fusesource/jansi/master/jansi/src/main/java/org/fusesource/jansi/WindowsAnsiOutputStream.java) class was very helpful.
