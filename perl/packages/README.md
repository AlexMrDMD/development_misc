[Ex1.pl](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/perl/packages/Ex1.pl) demonstrates that "top level" (that is not
part of a sub) is executed when the package is `use`d. [Ex1.pl](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/perl/packages/Ex1.pl)
uses [Ex1.pm](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/perl/packages/Ex1.pm) which, in turn, prints (that is: `say`s)
*This line is printed when the package is 'used'*.
