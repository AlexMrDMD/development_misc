#JLabel

A JLabel can be used to display

* [a string](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/java/swing/JComponent/JLabel/Simplest.java)

* [an icon](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/java/swing/JComponent/JLabel/GIF.java) (in this example, the icon is a gif)


[This example](https://raw.github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/master/java/swing/JComponent/JLabel/SettingText.java) uses a [Thread](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/development_misc/tree/master/java/Thread) and
`JLabel.setText` to update the text of a label with the value of a counter that increases every second.
